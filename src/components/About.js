            <p>
              From the Andes in Peru to South of Beijing, we scoured the globe
              to find yarns that are both animal-friendly and of the upmost
              quality. Alpaca, mink, and recycled silk are just some of the
              fibers we have in our arsenal. When it comes to your cat's
              comfort, we don't play dice.

              Fat cat, skinny cat, small cat, tall cat â€“ there's a CatScarf for
              all. We're here to cater to your cat's specific needs. You tell us
              your cat's measurements and we craft your loved one a scarf that
              is not only fashionable and made with love, but has an impeccable
              fit.

            <p>
              Each scarf is painstakingly knit by hand for the cat it was
              purchased for. We understand how important your cat is and what
              they deserve. Hours are spent clacking away, knitting until the
              scarf is flawless. Not all scarves make the cut; we accept nothing
              less than perfection.
